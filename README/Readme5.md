=>  Read data from (newmerged.csv).

steps Here performed:

step1:Feature Engineering: 
            Extract time-based features (hour, day, month, day_of_week, temperature).

step2:Modeling: 
        Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, train a Linear Regression model.

Step3:Evaluation: Calculate MSE, RMSE, R² score; plot Actual vs. Predicted and Residuals


Librieries Used Here:

        => pandas: Data manipulation and CSV handling.

       =>  numpy: Numerical operations and calculations.

        => matplotlib: Data visualization (plots).

       =>  seaborn: Statistical plots and visualizations.

       =>  sklearn: Machine learning (model training and evaluation).



Final output is:

        Metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²) and plots (Actual vs Predicted, Residual Analysis).
