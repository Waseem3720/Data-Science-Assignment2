=>      Reads the newmerged.csv file from a specified folder and processes it.


Key Points:

Step1:Data Loading: 
            Reads the newmerged.csv file from a specified folder and processes it.

Step2:Statistical Summary:
                 Computes key statistics like mean, skewness, and kurtosis for numerical columns.

Step3:Time Series Plot: 
                Plots the electricity demand over time.

Step4:Univariate Analysis: 
                Creates histograms, boxplots, and density plots for numerical features.

Step5:Correlation Analysis: 
                Generates a correlation matrix heatmap to check relationships between variables.

Step6:Time Series Decomposition:
                         Breaks down time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.

Step7:Stationarity Test: 
                Performs Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check if the data is stationary.
